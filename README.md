# Optimization Visualisation Tools

## Description
This repository is intended for :
- Students in Optimization that need to experience stuff in order to learn. 
- Professors in Optimization that want to include visual, practical and pedagogical elements in your lectures.

Matlab applications are proposed to visualize and understand optimization algorithms.

## Available tools:

- Gradient_Descent tool
  * New version : Gradient_Descent.mlapp
  * Old version : Gradient_Descent_interactive_examples 

Note : Available tools are functional but can still evolve (add features, bug corrections, etc.)

## Tools planned:
- Newton
- BFGS

## Prerequisites
Matlab R2016b or above to be able to run apps !
